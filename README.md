# PartyUp

PartyUp is a brand new mobile app that will eliminate all the phone calls and the organizational chaos that appears
whenever there is a new event at a Bar or Café. 

<h4>You and your friends don't know where to go this weekend?</h4>
This app gives you the option to see all of the nearby events in your local Bars or Café's. 
When you see an event you find interesting enough to go to, you just click on the reserve button,
or if you're not sure that your friends would like that event, you can just save it for later.
You can also see all of your incoming events and if you get lost on your way there, 
you can just open the map in the app and it will take you there in no time.

<h4>You need to cancel last minute?</h4>
Not to worry! You can just cancel your reservation and leave room for new customers to make a reservation.
<br>
<h4>But how do you enter new events?</h4>
When you create an account you have two choices:<br>
- Be a regular client<br>
- Be an owner of a Café/Bar<br>
If you're an owner, you can create new events and monitor the reservations. <br>
You can set a limit for the reservation so that you don't have any misunderstandings. Every reservation is marked with the usernames of the people that made a reservation.
